## Java-based Reinforcement-Learning Simulator (JRLSIm)

This project is general reinforcement-learning framework for the simulation of RL agents.

I developed this framework for the simulation of these this paper:

> 1. [Habits, action sequences and reinforcement learning] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22487034)

I also used it for the simulations of these two papers:

> 2. [Speed/Accuracy Trade-Off between the Habitual and the Goal-Directed Processes](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002055)

> 3. [A neurocomputational model for cocaine addiction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19635010)

Simulations of the first paper can be obtained by running ```sim/SEQ/Seq_Main```

Running the program for obtaining simulations of papers (2) and (3) is not straightforward at the moment. I will add more description for how to run the simulations.
